## Description

In the summer of 2020, my university asked me to build a SPA to look for social service projects and this is the result.

## Project Tools

This SPA was built using Nuxt and Storyblok for the content management.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
